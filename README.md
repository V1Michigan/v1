# V1 at Michigan

This is code repository for the website. Serverless Frontend built with Next.js + Tailwind CSS. Hosted on Netlify.

## How to work on this Project

1. First clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/V1Michigan/v1.git`. <br>
2. Make sure you enter the repository through terminal `cd <FilePath>/v1`. <br>
3. Create a new branch for your NEW feature: `git checkout -b FEATURE_NAME`. If you want to go to an existing feature: `git checkout FEATURE_NAME`.
4. Install dependencies: `yarn install`. We DO NOT use npm for this. <br>
5. Begin Devving: `npm run dev`. This will allow you to access a dev version of the site @ `localhost:3000` that will update automatically as you save files.
6. When you finish a part of your feature and wish to push the changes to the remote repository:
7. `git add changed_files` (replace changed_files with the actual file names you changed)
8. `git commit -m "meaningful commit message goes here"`
9. `git push --set-upstream origin FEATURE_NAME` (the next time you push to this branch you can just say `git push`).
